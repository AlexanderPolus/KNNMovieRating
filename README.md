In this project I used a K-Nearest-Neighbor approach to predict movie ratings for viewers based on their closest
3 neighbor users. Distance was determined in multidimensional vector space using cosine similarity. 

The KNN.py program established error for the program using K=3, and the CrossValidation.py program used cross validation to
determine the best small-number value for K to yield highest accuracy. 

Please read the results document for instructions on running the code and information about what the program does.
